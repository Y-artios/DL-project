# DL-project
This repository contains our code for the MVA Deep Learning project.
The code is based on the op-for-op PyTorch reimplementation of [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802v5) which can be found [here] (https://github.com/Lornatang/SRGAN-PyTorch#how-test-and-train)
