# DL-project
This repository contains our code for the MVA Deep Learning project.
The code is based on the op-for-op PyTorch reimplementation of [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802v5) which can be found [here](https://github.com/Lornatang/SRGAN-PyTorch#how-test-and-train).

## How Test and Train

Both training and testing only need to modify the `srresnet_config.py` file and `srgan_config.py` file.
